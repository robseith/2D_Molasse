For integration of the inj- temp. bc we see a waveform of the temperatur not as assumed 
a constant temperatur decrease.

- Mesh sensitivity of the mesh?

-> initial refined mesh at the injection location.
-> adaptive refined mesh at the injection location in dependence of the local temperature gradient.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial mesh refinement is not running with the reloading process, adaptive mesh refinement is also 
not running up to now.

For numerical issue the mesh at the injection point must be fine enough ~ 0.1 - 0.3 m.
To reach this resolution we have to remesh the initial mesh to a mesh size  of 5-10 m, so that after 5 initial 
remeshing the mesh size is 0.15 -0.3 m which is enougth to integrate a wellbore with a injection temperature.
